==About this repository==

Hi reader!

This repo is a basic set of  HTML5 tags and CSS styles (mainly structure) for the Tangent Snowball team to use for projects. It is not intended as a framework, or an exhaustive set of stringent rules rather, it is a way to ensure we all work in loosely the same way.        

Please make changes to the gh-pages branch, then marge them back to master.

Thanks!

TS FED Team
